# Project: Jekyll
`Project: Jekyll` is a datapack for `Minecraft: Java Edition 1.21.10`.

The end-goal is to add many monsters to the game, along with drops that allow the player to gain their abilities.
## Features
- [ ] Monsters
- [x] Items that give the powers of monsters
## Monsters
- [ ] Vampire
	- [x] `Vampiric Blood`
		- Strength
		- Speed
		- Flight (Gliding)
		- Lifesteal
- [ ] Werewolf
	- [ ] `Lycan Blood` (Powers only work at night)
		- Strength
		- Resistance
## Use
Currently, as there are no mobs to drop these items, they are given at the start. If they aren't, `/reload` will fix that.
